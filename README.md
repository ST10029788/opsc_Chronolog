## Pomodoro Timer 
This timer is situated on the home page, it will require minimal input, minimizing the need for
extensive data input when they are not in a highly productive mood, or feel it is a small
task but want to avoid burnout. 

These sessions will be an easy click-to-start and click-to-end with minimal data input, for
when users are not looking to do a task that needs heavy tracking and management.
The Pomodoro Tracker requires minimal input from users, focusing primarily on
starting and ending the timer. Users can easily start and stop the Pomodoro timer with
just a click, minimizing the need for extensive data input. This simplicity is ideal for
users who want to quickly initiate a Pomodoro session without the overhead of
complex task management.

## FAQ and Help Section
Most applications rely on a user having to research the application on their own or rely
on YouTube videos or Blog posts to efficiently use time tracking applications. The help
section will provide a manual for users instead, so that it is easy to access. The FAQ
will also provide information that users commonly want answers to. This streamlines
the process of using the app, so there is no learning curve or complexity.
